# Information:

# Program type: Text-adventure Game
# Project start date: 9-20-2017


### notes about my code ###
# All variables that are used specifically for lists will be suffixed with '_lst'
#For example Fruit_lst = ['apple', 'orange', 'grape']

#I use lots of external .txt files to draw descriptors, names, etc.
#you can find these files in the 'resources' folder.
#each set of lists is clearly named and in clearly marked (I hope...) folders.
