# Text-Venture
Just a little text adventure game I'm making, contributions are welcome! 

Code is in Python 3, and I'm just making the game as a kind of side project to help me learn.

if you want to make a contribution just kinda explain what you're doing to help me understand, because I AM'S Python noob.
